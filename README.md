# Website-project: Electronic Components Manufacturer
It is my side-project for my previous company: http://singreat.com/

At the time 2012, I didn't know too much about HTML/CSS/Javascript. I used the dreamweaver software to make it, modified by some free templates. I was an product manger/international sales representative in the electronics industry.
