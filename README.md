# Website-project-2012
It was my previous company's wesite: http://singreat.com/
At the time 2012, I didn't know too much about HTML/CSS/Javascript. I used the dreamweaver software to make it, modified by some free template.

It was my side-project for company. My job was an product manger/international sales representative in the electronics industry.
